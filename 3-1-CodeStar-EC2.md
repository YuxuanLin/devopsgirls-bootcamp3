# Deploy a static website to EC2 using CodeStar

## Learning Aims

### 1. Introduction to Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment

### 2. Introduction to AWS CodeStar, CodeCommit, and CodeDeploy

## Key concepts

- "*Continuous Integration*  is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible." - Martin Fowler, Chief Scientist, ThoughtWorks.
- "*Continuous Delivery* is the natural extension of Continuous Integration, an approach in which teams ensure that every change to the system is releasable, and release any version with the push of a button. Continuous Delivery aims to make releases boring, so that we can deliver frequently and get quick feedback on what users care about." - Thoughtworks.
- "*Continuous Deployment* is the next step of continuous delivery: Every change that passes the automated tests is deployed to production automatically. Continuous deployment should be the goal of most companies that are not constrained by regulatory or other requirements." - Puppet Labs

## Key technologies used

- AWS CodeStar: <https://aws.amazon.com/codestar/>
- AWS EC2: <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/>
- AWS CodeCommit: <https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/>
- AWS Code: <https://aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/>

## Prerequisites

You will need the following software installed on your workstation:  

- [Git client](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

**How to Install Git Client**

- For **Windows** download [here](https://gitforwindows.org/) the latest installer. Once the file has been download successfully, double click on the downloaded file to start the installation process, configuring it with the default options.  
 
- For **macOS** download the latest installer from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/). Once the file has been download successfully, start the installation process configuring it with the default options.  

- For **Debian/Ubuntu** using apt-get, open a terminal command line and run:

```javascript
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
```

- For **all platforms**, confirm the installation was successful by typing:

```javascript
git --version
```

**Note**: If you would like to know more about how to use git [here you are a book's link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) to understand everything about **git**. Enjoy it ;)!

Also you will need a **Text editor** such as [Sublime](www.sublimetext.com/3) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).  

## You'll be a CodeStar in no time

![CodeStar Project Name](/images/3-1-ec2-static-site/3_projectname.png)  

3.9.1. On the ***Review project details*** page, click the ***Edit Amazon EC2 Confirguration link***. Choose the VPC id, and subnet that has been supplied to you. Choose a t2.micro instance.  

![Edit EC2 Options](/images/3-1-ec2-static-site/5_editec2options.png)  

3.9.2. On the ***Review project details*** page, observe the AWS tools that will be utilisied and connected by CodeStar. In this case you should see that:

- CodeCommit is being for Source Control Management
- CodeDeploy is being used for Application Deployment, and
- CloudWatch is being used for Monitoring

3.10. Click on the ***Create Project*** button  

![Review Project](/images/3-1-ec2-static-site/4_reviewproject.png)  

3.11. When you see the ***Choose an Amazon EC2 Key Pair***, select ***devops_girls*** from the dropdown list, tick the acknowledgement box, and click the ***Create Project*** button (Normally you would make very sure you have access to this key in case you ever needed access to the EC2 instance)  

![Choose EC2 Key](/images/3-1-ec2-static-site/6_chooseec2key.png)  

3.12. On the ***It looks like this is your first time here.*** screen, enter your name in the ***Display Name*** field, and an accessible email address in the ***Email*** field
